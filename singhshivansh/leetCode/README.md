# LeetCode Solutions Python

Hey guys, I am mostly a FullStack Developer and CP never really attracted me but after scoring 5 stars in hackerrank problem solving I thought i should move to a better more difficult CP platform so I chose leetCode because being a dev i can't oversee the terrible UI/UX other platforms have

### Language
    - Python 90% times i'll be using python3
    - Sometimes maybe JS or go or C

### Quality of solutions
None of my solutions are bruteforce and on avergae they are in the top 60+% in time and top 40+% in space in the language used

**I have put the performance in a multiline comment write before the code and also the link to the question**


#### Any file with a `!` in their name implies it's a poor solution and may need contribution
